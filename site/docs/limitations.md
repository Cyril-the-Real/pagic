# Limitations

Pagic is excellent, but it also has some limitations.

Because the website built by Pagic uses some of the latest JavaScript and CSS features, you must use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to visit the website to have a complete experience.

The latest features used by Pagic include:

- Load esm through `<script type="module">` ([Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module))
- Load esm dynamically through `import()` ([Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module-dynamic-import))
- `import`, `export`, `export default` and other esm syntax ([Browser Supportability](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_statements_import))
- `async` function ([Browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions))
- Common ES6 syntax, including `let`, `const`, `() => {}` etc.
- CSS Variables ([browser compatibility](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables))
